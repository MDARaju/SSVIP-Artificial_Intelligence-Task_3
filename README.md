# SSVIP-Artificial_Intelligence-Task_3

This code utilizes the face_recognition library to perform face recognition on a set of known images.
It loads known face images from a specified directory, encodes them, and compares the faces in a test image to the known faces. 
If a match is found, it annotates the test image with the recognized person's name and displays the result.
